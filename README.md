# N-Body-Problem
3/n body problem

Erik Hale

Having completed the 2 Body Problem Simulation, this code will be a simulation of the 3 Body Problem / N-Body Problem, where there are n amounts of masses that affect each other gavitationally. This could simulate how objects in star systems move or how planets with moons are affected. The idea would be to have a text file to upload information to, so that files could be uploaded with ease.
